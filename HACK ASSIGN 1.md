Write a Python program to accept the user's first and last name and then getting them printed in
the the reverse order with a space between first name and last name.


```python
a=input("Enter the first name : ")
b=input("Enter the second name : ")
print("Full name of the user is " + b + " "+ a)
```

    Enter the first name : k
    Enter the second name : k
    Full name of the user is k k
    

Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple
of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a
comma-separated sequence on a single line.


```python
number=[]
for x in range(2000, 3200):
    if (x%7==0) and (x%5>0):
        number.append(str(x))
print (','.join(number))
```

Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm.
Formula: V=4/3 * Ï€ * r
3


```python
pi = 3.1415926
radius = 6
Volume= 4/3*pi* radius**3
print('The volume of the sphere is: ',Volume)
```

    The volume of the sphere is:  904.7786687999999
    


```python
pi = 3.1415926
radius = int(input("Enter the radius of the sphere :"))
Volume= 4/3*pi* radius**3
print('The volume of the sphere is: ',Volume)
```

    Enter the radius of the sphere :8
    The volume of the sphere is:  2144.6605482666664
    

Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and
generate a list.


```python
data= input("Enter the numbers separated by commas : ")
list = data.split(",")
print('List form of given numbers : ',list)
```

    Enter the numbers separated by commas : 3,2,4
    List form of given numbers :  ['3', '2', '4']
    

Write a Python program to reverse a word after accepting the input from the user.
Sample Output
Input word: Ineuron
Output: noruenl


```python
a = "Ineuron" [::-1]
print(a)
